# Setting Up Nmap Device Endpoints

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up FastAPI endpoints for managing Nmap device data within an MVC project structure. Each step includes specific files that need to be integrated or created to establish these endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy for ORM
- Pydantic for data validation

## Step 1: Model Creation

Create a model file named `nmap_scan_data.py` under the `models` directory. This file should define a class with fields mapping to the attributes found in the Nmap XML scan data (`021525.xml`). Here is an example of what this might look like:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from database import Base

class NmapScanData(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'nmap_devices'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    hostname = Column(String, index=True)
    ip_address = Column(String, index=True)
    port = Column(Integer)
    service = Column(String)
```

## Step 2: Controller Setup

Create a controller file named `NmapDeviceController.py` under the `controllers` directory. This controller should include CRUD operations facilitated by FastAPI path operations such as `@router.post()`, `@router.get()`, `@router.put()`, and `@router.delete()`:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from models.nmap_scan_data import NmapScanData
from schemas.nmap_device_schema import NmapDeviceCreate, NmapDevice
router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/", response_model=NmapDevice)
def create_nmap_device(device: NmapDeviceCreate):
    # Implementation for creating a device
    pass

@router.get("/{device_id}", response_model=NmapDevice)
def read_nmap_device(device_id: int):
    # Implementation for reading a device
    pass

@router.put("/{device_id}", response_model=NmapDevice)
def update_nmap_device(device_id: int, device: NmapDeviceCreate):
    # Implementation for updating a device
    pass

@router.delete("/{device_id}")
def delete_nmap_device(device_id: int):
    # Implementation for deleting a device
    pass
```

## Step 3: Routing

Define your API paths in a routing file `nmap_device_routes.py` which should be included in your main FastAPI application file (`app.py` or `main.py`). Use `app.include_router(nmap_device_router)` to add these routes.

## Step 4: Database Integration

Ensure your SQLAlchemy ORM is correctly set up to communicate with your database, handling the operations triggered by your controller functions.

## Step 5: Schema Definition

Optionally, define Pydantic schemas in `nmap_device_schema.py` for data validation and serialization of your input and output data structures.

## Step 6: Adding Dependencies

If your endpoints require specific dependencies, set these up in a `dependencies.py` file, such as authentication or database session connections.

## Conclusion

Once you've completed the above steps, your FastAPI application will be equipped to handle CRUD operations for Nmap devices. This setup will be a part of a larger MVC architecture aimed at providing robust management for Nmap scan data.
